## Clash royale server for version 1.9.2/1.9.3 written in .NET


## Battles
The server supports battles, for those a patched client is neccessary.

[See the wiki for a tutorial](https://github.com/retroroyale/ClashRoyale/wiki/Patch-for-battles)

## How to start

#### Requirements:
  - [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
  - MySql Database (on Debian i suggest LAMP with PMA or on windows i suggest XAMPP with PMA)

for Ubuntu use these commands to set it up:
```
mkdir ClashRoyale
git clone https://github.com/Zordon1337/ZrdRoyale.git && cd ClashRoyale/src/ClashRoyale

dotnet publish "ClashRoyale.csproj" -c Release -o app
```
Run the server once to create the config.json file.

To configurate your server, such as the database you have to edit the ```config.json``` file.

#### Run the server:

###### Main Server:
```dotnet app/ClashRoyale.dll```

###### Battle Server:
```dotnet app/ClashRoyale.Battles.dll```

#### Update the server:
###### Main Server:
```git pull && dotnet publish "ClashRoyale.csproj" -c Release -o app && dotnet app/ClashRoyale.dll```

###### Battle Server:
```git pull && dotnet publish "ClashRoyale.Battles.csproj" -c Release -o app && dotnet app/ClashRoyale.Battles.dll```
